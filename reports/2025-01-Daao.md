## [H-01]Lack of Access Control in `Daao::finalizeFundraising`

### Description
when Funding Campaign goal is meet the `Daao::finalizeFundraising` Function is called to mint `DaooToken` for contributors in this campaign, transfer `amountForTreasury` and mint a `NonFungiblePosition`

```solidity

    function finalizeFundraising(...) external {
         require(goalReached, "Fundraising goal not reached");
         ...
        
@>                   token.mint(contributor, tokensToMint);

            ...
@>                   (bool success, ) = owner().call{value: amountForTreasury}("");
         ...
@>                           (uint256 tokenId, , , ) = POSITION_MANAGER.mint(params);


}
```
### Impact 
+ The Liquidity is locked in arbitrary Price Range till the `fundExpiry` is reached

### Mitigation 
+ Use OZ `ownable`


## [M-01] Users cannot Contribute In Public FundRaising Campaigns
### Description
According to natspac in `Daao.sol` When Daao Owner create a public fundraising campaign he set `maxWhitelistAmount` to zero and `maxPublicContributionAmount` to specific value so anyone can contribute in this campaign and not exceed `maxPublicContributionAmount`

[Daao.sol#L58C1-L61C48](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L58C1-L61C48)

The issue arises from the implementation of `Daao::contribute` function where it always check that the `msg.sender` has a tier (aka.. Whitlisted) even in public contributions.which will make this function always revert in public fundraising campaigns

[Daao.sol#L140C8-L142C68](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L140C8-L142C68)

```solidity

 function contribute() public payable nonReentrant {
...
        WhitelistTier userTier = userTiers[msg.sender];
@> require(userTier != WhitelistTier.None, "Not whitelisted");
...

}

```

### Mitigation 

+ There are alot of mitigations one of them is refactoring `Daao::contribute` function as following

  ```solidity

     function contribute() public payable nonReentrant {
    ...
    // Checks for private fundraising campaigns
    if (maxWhitelistAmount > 0) {
        WhitelistTier userTier = userTiers[msg.sender];
        require(userTier != WhitelistTier.None, "Not whitelisted");

        // Contribution must follow tier limit
        uint256 userLimit = tierLimits[userTier];
        require(
            contributions[msg.sender] + msg.value <= userLimit,
            "Exceeding tier limit"
        );
        require(
            contributions[msg.sender] + msg.value <= maxWhitelistAmount,
            "Exceeding maxWhitelistAmount"
        );
    } 
  // check for public ones 
  else {
          require(
              contributions[msg.sender] + msg.value <= maxPublicContributionAmount,
              "Exceeding maxPublicContributionAmount"
          );
      }
  ...
  }

  ```

## [L-01] lack of slippage protection in `Daao::finalizeFundraising`
  ### Description
  When the `Daao::finalizeFundraising` function is called, a `NonFungiblePosition` is minted, indicating that liquidity has been added.
  
  [Daao.sol#L352C62-L352C65](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L352C62-L352C65)
  
  The issue arises in the params used to mint this postiton where `amount0min` and `amount1min` is set to zero which indicates that 100% slippage is allowed This means, that this action could lead to the caller losing up to 100% of their tokens due to slippage.
  
  [Daao.sol#L340C3-L341C19](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L340C3-L341C19)
  
  
  ### Impact 
  + every user who interacts with this function will risk having their funds stolen by MEV bots.
  
  ### Mitigation 
  
  + allow the caller to specify values for `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` instead of setting them to 0.

## [I-01] Dangerous use of deadline parameter
### Description

When Fundraising goal is reached `Daao::finalizeFundraising` function is called to do certain on things one of them is to mint `nonFungiblePosition` then transfer it to the locker

[Daao.sol#L331C1-L371C11](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L331C1-L371C11)

```solidity 
  function finalizeFundraising(...) external {
...
 @>  (uint256 tokenId, , , ) = POSITION_MANAGER.mint(params);
 ...

@>  POSITION_MANAGER.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            lockerAddress,
            tokenId
        );
...

}



```

The Issue Arises in params provided to `POSITION_MANAGER` to mint the `nonFungiblePosition` where deadline is set to `block.timestamp` which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.where deadline is set to prevent excution of pending transactions Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined, the check will end up comparing `block.timestamp` against the same value

[Daao.sol#L331C1-L371C11](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L331C1-L371C11)

```solidity 
        INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams
            memory params = INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams(
                token0,
                token1,
                TICKING_SPACE,
                initialTick,
                upperTick,
                amountToken0ForLP,
                amountToken1ForLP,
                0,
                0,
                address(this),
   @>             block.timestamp,
                sqrtPriceX96
            );

   (uint256 tokenId, , , ) = POSITION_MANAGER.mint(params);


```

### Mitigation 

+ Add a deadline parameter to the `Daao::finalizeFundraising` function and forward this parameter to the underlying call to the `POSITION_MANAGER` contract.

## [I-02] `protocolAdmin` can RugPull user's funds
### Description
When there's emergency the protocolAdmin call `Daao::emergencyEscape` to send the contract balance to the protocolAdmin

[Daao.sol#L450C3-L455C6](https://github.com/daaoai/daaoai_contracts/blob/85b759da2eda23a71032c3dac023a73e63afa167/src/Daao.sol#L450C3-L455C6)

This means that the owner can withdraw tokens contributed by other users even if the fundRaising campaign is still active. There have been some previous attacks like this as the Merlin Dex Rug Pull was a significant incident that occurred on April 25, 2023, where the decentralized exchange (DEX) Merlin suffered a loss of approximately $1.8 million. The incident was initially believed to be a hack, but it was later confirmed to be an internal rug pull because of an overstepping in owner privileges.

### Mitigation

+ since the function is for emergency situations.creating a function which the owner could call to set an `emergency variable` to true in case of emergency and a function that allows users to withdraw their funds directly when this variable is set to true. would be a better approach
